Forth is a tool for evolutionary programming. This is the binary
distribution of lina 5.# . The following applies to all versions 5.#
of lina  in 32 or 64 bits. Contrary to what you expect from me,
this documentation is common to lina32 and lina64, because there
are virtually no differences except cell size.

lina is the Linux native (= c-less) version of ciforth (common Intel
Forth), an interpret environment and compiler for Forth. It is (large
and by) compliant with the ISO Forth standard; the CORE wordset is
fully implemented. The small, classic, indirect threaded kernel
contains the essential, i.a. file access and exceptions. Its power is
multiplied by an extensive source library, that add i.a. a decompiler
and integrated 386 assembler. It is fully self contained; if you want
to understand a compiler in all details, this is your best, if not
only, choice. ciforth sports the highest documentation to binary
proportion in the EDP industry, barring m4 on Coherent.

RELEASE CONTENT
Don't panic! ciforth is just two files, binary and library.
The rest is documentation (plus examples and source).

 READMElina.txt  This file
 lina32 / lina64 The Forth interpreter compiler

You can rebuild lina from the .s file, instruction are in this source.
The latest version and OSX and MS-windows versions can be fetched from
    http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/ciforth.html
This contains also a link to the generic system that is recommended over
the .s file if you want to make extensive change.

Unpack in the directory where you want to use it by :
    tar fxz lina-5####.gz

The following applies to the 32 and 64 bit version alike, replace lina
by lina32 or lina 64 as appropriate. A symbolic link to lina may
point to either version.

Now you can use lina by :
    lina
or
    lina -e

Print the manual (150 pages) by :
    lpr ci86.lina##.ps
or view it:
    gv ci86.lina##.ps
or view by :
    info -f ./ci86.lina##.info

View the same information in ci86.lina##.pdf with an appropriate tool

Viewing the file ``ci86.lina##.html'' with a html viewer,
gives a reference that is concise but has more cross links.

For customized installation see the -i option in the manual.

For system wide installation (32-bit) the following is recommended:
    su
    ./lina32 -g 60 lina32+
    ./lina32+ -i /usr/bin/lina32 /usr/lib/forth.lab
    ln -s /usr/bin/lina32 /usr/bin/lina
    chmod 755 /usr/bin/lina32
    chmod 644 /usr/lib/forth.lab

    mkdir /usr/share/doc/lina || true
    cp ci86.lina32.* /usr/share/doc/lina
    cp lina32.1      /usr/share/man/man1

The above increases Forth's dictionary space from 1 to 61 Mb.
Installing lina64 is similar, but now you may want to grow
by 8000 or 128000 Mbyte.

Once installed you can use lina :
    Compile the example program by : lina -c hellow.frt
    Try the script by : wc.script *.s *.txt *.html

NOTE ON "info"
The "info" system for program documentation actively discourages
adding documentation to a system, by hiding how a .info file
can be installed. The nice folks of Debian had added a separate
program install-info , but as of 2015 that has been replaced by
ginstall-info that reinstates the former unworkable situation
with info files.
Your only option is to do
   info -f <absolute-path>
[unless you're a hacker, then start up info. Find a <subject> that
exists. locate <subject>.info . Copy documentation there and edit
the dir file in that directory.]
